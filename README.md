Get-GDXProcessOwner
===================

PowerShell function used to help find user-context ownership for processes/services using WMI to join running processes and services and determine the ownership of processes on a local or remote system.  Please use the built-in help or reference the source code where most of the documentation is in the preamble of the function.



TODO List
+ Finish adding functionality for alternate credentials (Get-WmiObject throws an error saying it will not accept credentials for local queries)
